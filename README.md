# Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree - Project 5

This project is about developing a Generative Adversarial Neural Network to generate new face images. We use the MIST dataset initially to test the network before training on the Face images.
We are using a corpus of celebrity dataset of size 28x28 pixels for training the face generation model. 

Datasets:
* MINST
* CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA) dataset

Libraries:
* Tensorflow
* Matplotlib
